# not_so_basic_arduino
arduino assignments that are new to this year

# hello_functions
I learned that functions are like variables except you can bind the variable with a whole line of code instead of a number

In this assignment I used functions to code a sensor to read distance

# newping
I learned the significance of the newping library

In this assignment I moved a servo depending on the distance detected by a sensor
